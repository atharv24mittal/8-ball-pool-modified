This is a python code which helps to make a 8-ball pool game using pygame. We follow all the rules of 8-ball pool. We also save the record of the winners in a separate text file.
I have used the small balls which are termed without underscore, however you can use the other balls as well, you will need to change the co-ordinate for that.
